## Playing the Game

You can obtain pre-built releases of the game from the [Releases](https://github.com/20zinnm/smasteroids/releases) page. These are generally more reliable than development builds.

If your platform is not already included, you may also compile the program yourself using a standard Go toolchain with CGO enabled.
