> A game in honor of the St. Mark's science faculty and the Winn Science Building.

## Playing the Game

You can obtain pre-built releases of the game from the [Releases](https://github.com/20zinnm/smasteroids/releases) page. These are generally more reliable than development builds.

If your platform is not already included, you may also compile the program yourself uding a standard Go toolchain.
